# UI Annotations
To complete this practice, you must be familiar with basic CSS styling including typography and the box model. You also need to be familiar with styling anchors (hyperlinks) and the concept of UI annotations.

## Objectives
- Practice following UI annotations
- Practice styling anchors

## Tasks: Beginners
- Accept a set of UI annotations from your assigned partner. Implement the proposed UI design. Make this implementation live on the web. You'll submit the URL on Blackboard.
- Note any assumptions you needed to make, any changes you made (and why), and anything you needed to address that wasn't noted in the annotation. You'll submit these notes on Blackboard.
